This is a Next.js project using Next 15 and shadcn, along with framer-motion for animations.

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Use shadcn for components.
- Use framer-motion for animations.
- Use Next 15 for the framework.

My goal is to create a beautiful, responsive portfolio site to share what I've been working on and advertise my services.

I am using pnpm for the package manager.
